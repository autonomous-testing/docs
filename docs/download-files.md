# ðŸ“¥ Download files

Test your web application's file download functionality to ensure users can successfully download files, reports, and other content.

## Overview

File downloads are a common feature in web applications, from document exports to media downloads. Wopee.io helps you test these download functionalities to ensure they work correctly across different browsers and scenarios.

## Types of downloadable files to test

### Common web app downloads

- **Documents**: PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets, presentations
- **Reports**: Generated reports, analytics exports, user data exports
- **Media files**: Images, videos, audio files, graphics
- **Data exports**: CSV files, JSON exports, database backups
- **Software**: Installers, updates, mobile apps

### Dynamic vs static downloads

- **Static files**: Pre-existing files stored on the server
- **Dynamic files**: Generated on-demand based on user data or requests
- **Streaming downloads**: Large files downloaded in chunks
- **Authenticated downloads**: Files requiring login or permissions

## How to test file downloads

### Creating download tests with AI

Use prompts to generate tests that verify download functionality:

!!! tip "Use prompt for download testing"

    Create tests that verify file download functionality with specific prompts.

    ```prompt
