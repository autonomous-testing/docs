There are 2 main options to start with Wopee.io and WebdriverIO visual testing:

1. Clone the WebdriverIO Integration Template Project.
2. Install the WebdriverIO into your existing project.

We recommend starting with the WebdriverIO Integration Template Project to quickly set up visual testing with Wopee.io and WebdriverIO.

## Wopee.io + WebdriverIO

Wopee.io integrates seamlessly with WebdriverIO to enhance test coverage, expedite maintenance, and ensure more resilient test runs. With a vision of autonomous visual testing, Wopee.io enables easy visual validation integration into your existing WebdriverIO tests, providing an extra layer of quality assurance. With Wopee.io, you can easily compare screenshots (from web and mobile testing), manage baselines, and automate visual testing within your WebdriverIO test suite.

WebdriverIO is a popular test automation framework for Node.js that provides a simple and concise syntax for writing tests. It supports various browsers and devices, making it suitable for testing web applications across different platforms. WebdriverIO offers a rich set of features, including a powerful API, support for various testing frameworks, and seamless integration with popular tools and services.

Key features of WebdriverIO include:
