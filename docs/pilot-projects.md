### Priority Levels Explained

- **High (H)**: These metrics are directly impacted by Wopee.io and will show clear improvements even in a short 8-week pilot. They represent the core value proposition of autonomous testing.

- **Medium (M)**: Improvements are possible but depend on scope, defect inflow, and business involvement. These metrics may show improvement but require longer observation periods.

- **Low (L)**: While savings will appear, these metrics are harder to quantify convincingly in a short pilot. Better measured over multiple releases.

### Why These Metrics Matter

**Test Coverage & Creation Time**: The foundation of testing efficiency. Faster test creation with broader coverage means more comprehensive testing with less effort.

**Time to First Suite & Regression Cycle**: Critical for CI/CD integration. Faster feedback loops enable more frequent releases and earlier defect detection.

**Maintenance Effort**: Often the hidden cost of automated testing. Self-healing capabilities dramatically reduce ongoing maintenance burden.

**Defect Metrics**: Quality indicators that demonstrate the effectiveness of autonomous testing in finding and preventing issues.

**Cost Metrics**: Business justification for continued investment in autonomous testing solutions.
